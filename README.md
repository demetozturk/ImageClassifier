# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

This repository contains the project developed as part of the UDACITY Python for AI program.

Overview
This repository includes code for image classification, allowing you to train the model using your own images. The project has been implemented as a command-line application, with training.py and predict.py providing the functionality for model training and prediction.
